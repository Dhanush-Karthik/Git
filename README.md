# Git-Basics
Basic commands and concepts of Git

## Clone a remote repository

To clone a remote git repository use the following command:

`git clone <Https/SSH repository link>`

## Get the status of the local repository

To get the status of the local repository use the following command:

`git status`

## Tell git to track your new file

To tell git to track your new file use the command:

`git add <file name>`

The `git add` command moves changes from the working directory to the Git staging area. The staging area is where you prepare a snapshot of a set of changes before committing them to the official history.

`git add .` adds all the changes to the staging area.
